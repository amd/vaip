test_onnx_runner
================
| Test_onnx_runner is a tool to run your model with random generated inputs.
| So, the end user can test his/her model without the need to write preprocessing and postprocessing.
| It is installed under  ~/.local/{build_version}/bin.

| On windows, it is recommended to call the executable with run_test_onnx_runner.bat so it can avoid pathing issues.
| On Linux, several paths must be set. To keep things simple, I paste the command below.

.. code-block:: bash

    env `cat /workspace/vaip/debug_env.txt` LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/xilinx/xrt/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/usr/local/lib:/home/{username}/.local/{build_version}/lib:/home/{username}/.local/{build_version}/opt/xilinx/xrt/lib  ~/.local/{build_version}/bin/test_onnx_runner {model_path}

| env cat is just setting the variable listed in debug_env.txt which contains several debugging environment variables.
| On Linux, everything is dynamic linked. So setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a must.
| Finally, the executable takes a model path as the bare minimum.
| The program should output "done" if the execution is finished without any error.

There are a few options that worth mentioning:
| Use -c if you want to set the config file instead of using the default path listed in the debug_env.txt.
| Use -e if you want to encrypt your model with a 256-bit key.
