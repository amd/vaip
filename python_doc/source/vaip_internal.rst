========================

Implement ONNX Runtime Execution Provider
-----------------------------------------

The onnxruntime ExecutionProvider interface is defined at 
`ORT ExecutionProviders`_

..  code-block:: cpp

    class ExecutionProviders {
        ...
        // step 1. partition
        virtual std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ComputeCapability>>
        GetCapability(const onnxruntime::GraphViewer& graph_viewer,
                const IKernelLookup& kernel_lookup) const;
        // step 2. real computation
        virtual common::Status Compile(const std::vector<FusedNodeAndGraph>& fused_nodes_and_graphs,
                                 std::vector<NodeComputeInfo>& node_compute_funcs);
        ...
    }

.. _ORT ExecutionProviders: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/b7ae293be05c89a0cb623feec4d2d2cbf006e4c3/include/onnxruntime/core/framework/execution_provider.h#L60

VAIP plugin does not need to implement the above to APIs, they can simply implement 

Graph Partition
---------------

`GetCapability` returns a bunch of `ComputeCapability` objects and each object represents a single subgraph.

In order to cache the partition result in JSON, we translate it into protobuf defination as blow. 
Protobuf API supports serialize and deserialize a protobuf message to and from a JSON object.

.. literalinclude:: ../../vaip/src/capability.proto
    :start-at: message MetaDefProto 
    :language: protobuf
    :linenos:

#. `id` any string, it must be unique name for the corresponding subgraph. 
#. `inputs` is a list of input names, its element must be a graph input, a graph constant initializer or an output of a node. refer to `ONNX IR Node`_
#. `outputs` is a list of output names, its element must be a output of a node.
#. `nodes` is a list of nodes, its element must be a output of a node, when a node has multiple output, the first output is used.
#. `constant_initializers` is list of graph constant initializers.
#. `device`, this is an extension field used by VAIP, this field is used to find the custom op impemention plugin, see <TODO>
