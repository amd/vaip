Read/Load Const Data
====================
Reading/Writing const data is quite straightforward.
To read a const data in action(), const_data() can be called on a matched node like the following.

.. code-block:: python

    def action(self, w_scale, **kwargs):
        w_scale.const_data()[0]

| We recommend use a binary file to store const data as converting a float number to string may lead to precision loss.
| The file location can be fixed or unique for each model by calling self.cache_dir()

.. code-block:: python

    wts_file = self.cache_dir() + "/" + name + ".bin"
    file = open(wts_file, "wb")
    weight = np.array(input_w.const_data(), dtype=np.int8).reshape(
        input_w.shape()[0], input_w.shape()[1]
    )
    file.write(np.array(weight).tobytes())
    file.close()

| To make reading the file easier, the meta_def comes with a <str, str> map can be set on python side and get on the C++ side.
| You can save the file name like the following.

.. code-block:: python

     meta_def.set_generic_param("wts_file", str(wts_file))
