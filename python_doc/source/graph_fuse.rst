Fuse
====
| Previous, we briefly mentioned an example on graph fusing at :ref:`pass <simple-fuse-label>`.
| To see the API description, check :ref:`try_fuse API <fuse-api-label>`.

try_fuse()
----------

| try_fuse() is called to check if a graph fusing on the inputs and outputs inside action() is possible.
| The algorithm would traverses from the outputs all the way to the inputs to detect if there is a leakage.
| A leakage is defined as a node that the an output of the fused node depends but not lists as an input.
| If a leakage occurs, it returns None to indicate that such a fuse is impossible. Otherwise, it returns a meta def.
| Please note the meta_def's name must be unique.

fuse()
-------
| It fuses the nodes between inputs and outputs inclusively into a new node named super_layer.
| Please note action() takes a boolean as return to indicate if a graph transformation is done in this matched pattern.
| So please return the return value of action().
