Where
===============

| where() is used to describe relationship other than topological relationship.
| For example, if we only need to act on a node only if the node's input has 4 dimensions, we would return false on where() when this condition is not met.  
| It is optional. If it is undefined, the pass would just skip this function.
| In general, it should have the same arguments as the action().

   :dedent:

| In this example, the first Mul node is checked for if the consumers(how many nodes take it as a input) are greater than 1.
| Then two consts' must have an identical shape.
| Otherwise, the action() would not be called.
