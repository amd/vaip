Anchor Point
===============
| A node can be ordered, replaced and created during each graph transformation.
| To preserve the invariant property of each graph transformation, the input and output of a subgraph should be identical before and after each transformation.
| Take a concrete example, if the custom ops are implemented using NCWH layout. But the inputs and outputs of the original graph is using NCHW layout,
| the subgraph should be transformed from NCWH back NCHW so the onnxruntime can continue with the output that has the correct layout.
| 
| Thus, anchor point is used to record such connection such as tranposing, converting data in the new graph.
| It can also be thought as a way the trace the origin of a created node which we will use during computation and debugging.
|
| We will use a few examples to demonstrate how to use set_anchor_point.
| Note calling create_node would indirectly calls set_anchor_point as well.
| For more information, see :ref:`builder-label`.

The first example is to combining a float2fix and fix2float into a new subgraph.

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
        "Input" -> "float2fix"
        "float2fix" -> "fix2float";
   }

To preserve the invariant property, the output should be as same as the fix2float's output.
So, we should set the anchor point to fix2float.

.. literalinclude:: ../../vaip/python/voe/passes/merge_fix.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: MergeFix.action
   :dedent:

| This is an extremely simple case. The output of newly created node would replace the output of last node(fix2float) in previous graph.
| Here is a slightly complicated case.
| Suppose, we want to create a new graph that moves the transpose to the bottom from the following graph.
| So, it is easier to combine two transposes into one transpose in the following passes.

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
        "Input" -> "Transpose"
        "Transpose" -> "ReLU";
   }

Obviously, we need to reset the anchor point for every node. The following showed how to do it with anchor_point.


.. code-block:: python

   class swap_ReLU_transpose(Rule):
      def pattern(self):
         input = wildcard()
         transpose = node("Transpose", input)
         relu = node("Relu", transpose)
         return relu.build(locals())

    def action(self, input, relu, transpose, **kwargs):
        order = t.attr("perm")
        shape = convert_shape(input.shape(), order)
        new_relu = self.create_node("Relu", attrs=same_as(relu), data_type=same_as(relu), inputs=[input], anchor_point=(relu, transpose(shape)))
        new_transpose = self.create_node("Transpose", attrs=same_as(transpose), data_type=same_as(transpose), inputs=[new_relu], anchor_point=relu)
        return new_transpose

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
        "Input" -> "ReLU"
        "ReLU" -> "Transpose";
   }

| The newly created transpose is the output of the graph. So it should replace the output of last node(ReLU) in the previous graph.
| It also takes the output of newly created ReLU, hence the inputs are set to equal to [input].
| This is similar to last example.
| The interesting point is setting the anchor point of newly created ReLU which we will refer as new_relu.
| What is relationship between new_relu and the ReLU it derived from?
| The output of the ReLU is tranposed where the new_relu is not tranposed yet!
| So by calling set_anchor_point with a tuple of an argument we can described the relationship as relu + a tranpose = new_relu.
