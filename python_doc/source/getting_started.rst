Getting Started
===============
In order to provide a consistent user experience, this tutorial is ran using :ref:`test-onnx-runner-label` with model resnet50_pt from test_onnx_runner repo.
The tutorial contains the basic building blocks to write a pass in Python.
The :ref:`pass-label` contains the general layout of a pass.

| To create a pass, a required :ref:`pattern-label`, :ref:`action-label` and optional :ref:`where-label` must be implemented.
| To read out const data from the graph and load it at computation, check out :ref:`const-label`.
| To fuse a graph, check out :ref:`fuse-label`.
