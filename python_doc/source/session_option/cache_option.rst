Cache Option
============

| To avoid recompiling the onnx model, the compiled models are saved under :ref:`cache directory <cache_dir_api-label>`.
| Next time when the session is created, the cache hit would allow us to skip compilation and go straight to computation.
| But, the default path is not always desirable when we want to deploy the model.
| So, we could specify a model's cache directory in the session option like the following:

.. code-block:: python

    session = onnxruntime.InferenceSession(
        '[model_file].onnx',
        providers=["VitisAIExecutionProvider"],
        provider_options=[{
            "config_file":"xxx",
            "cacheKey": "3f97582a85b8ae1be41127f326bbf9b2",
            "cacheDir": "/some_path"
    }])

Note: the cache directory is now set at the directory {cacheDir + cacheKey}.
