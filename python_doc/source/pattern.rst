Pattern
===============

Multi-Node pattern
------------------

| In the :ref:`pass-label` section, a pattern of node with four inputs and op type of NonMaxSuppression.
| This is the simplest pattern possible. More complex pattern is used in the real-world.
| Let use a slightly more involved pattern as an exmaple.

.. literalinclude:: ../../vaip/python/voe/passes/merge_fix.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: MergeFix.pattern
   :dedent:

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
        "*" -> "float2fix"
        "float2fix" -> "fix2float";
   }

From the diagram above, we can see that instead of patterning to a single node from previous example, now the pattern matches several nodes.
Each node passes its previous node as its node input.
Note: Only the nodes that are direct/indrect inputs to node being built would be used. Other nodes would be discarded.

Optional node input
-------------------

Optional argument is essential part of pattern matching. By checking https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md, we can see
there are many operations that have optional arguments, such as "RESIZE".
[] is determined to denote optional argument. Although this is normally used to denote list, but it is repurposed as such.


.. code-block:: python

    def pattern(self):
        p_input = wildcard()
        roi = wildcard()
        scale = wildcard()
        sizes = wildcard()
        resize = node("Resize", p_input, [roi], [scale], [sizes])
        return resize.build(locals())


There isn't much of difference besides added [] at pattern function.
However, be careful at action() function.
If you add optional argument as parameter to action function. It would throw key-not-found error.
So, iterating the kwargs would be the approach to detect which node input is matched.

.. code-block:: python

    def action(self, resize, **kwargs):
        inputs = []
        for key in kwargs:
            inputs.append(kwargs[key])

Subpattern
----------
| A pattern can be consisted of multiple identical components. Writing such a pattern in a single function can clumsy and error-prone.
| Thus, we introduce the concept of subpattern. Just like a wildcard() function, it can be used as a node's input.
| Take the following graph as an example, we can see many identical components.

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
        "x" -> "DequantizeLinear";
        "x_scale" -> "DequantizeLinear";
        "x_zero_point" -> "DequantizeLinear";

        "x " -> "DequantizeLinear ";
        "x_scale " -> "DequantizeLinear ";
        "x_zero_point " -> "DequantizeLinear ";

        "x  " -> "DequantizeLinear  ";
        "x_scale  " -> "DequantizeLinear  ";
        "x_zero_point  " -> "DequantizeLinear  ";

        "DequantizeLinear"-> "Conv";
        "DequantizeLinear "-> "Conv";
        "DequantizeLinear  "-> "Conv";
        "Conv"-> "Relu";
        "Relu"-> "QuantizeLinear";
        "scale"-> "QuantizeLinear";
        "quantize"-> "QuantizeLinear";
   }

| Thus, to create a subpattern of DequantizeLinear, we write the function as the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../vaip/python/voe/generate_test_cases_pattern/p50_dp_conv_relu_q.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: dequant
   :dedent:

| There are three differences between a subpattern and a pattern.
| First, the subpattern only return a node which is an input of another node in the pattern which we will present next.
| Second, the subpattern must somehow give the locals() information back to the pattern.
| So, update_subpattern_env() is called as such with locals().
| Finally, the subpattern must accept the env and prefix as its arguments and use these later in update_subpattern_env()

.. literalinclude:: ../../vaip/python/voe/generate_test_cases_pattern/p50_dp_conv_relu_q.py
   :language: python
   :pyobject: pattern
   :dedent:

| There are a few differences are well.
| the build is called with env instead of locals() because now we need every variables' information in the subpattern as well.
| The env has such information after calling update_subpattern_env().
| It also has to be created using create_subpattern_env().
| Each subpattern is called with a prefix so the every variable can be accessed in the action().
| To access of the s_scale with prefix "X" in action() function, add X_s_scale on the argument of action().

Multi-Consumer Node
-------------------
| The node's consumer is never specified on the pattern() function.
| So, to match for a multi-consumer Add node like following, the pattern() is identical to a single-consumer Add node.

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
        "Add" -> "MatMul";
        "Add" -> "MatMul ";
        "Add" -> "MatMul  ";
   }

| But, we need to filter out the Add node with multi-consumer using get_consumers() in where().
| Since get_consumers return a list of nodes, we can iterate each one of them to do some further filtering if wanted. 

.. code-block:: python

   def pattern(self):
      add = node("Add", wildcard())
      return add.build(locals())

   def where(self, add):
      consumer = add.get_consumers()
      is_multi_consumer = len(consumer) == 3
      if not is_multi_consumer:
         return False
      for n in consumer:
         if n.op_type() != "MatMul":
            return False
      return True

If a graph fuse is needed for this pattern, the input should be Add node. the output should be the consumers. Like the following:

.. code-block:: python

   def action(self, add):
      inputs = [add]
      outputs = add.get_consumers()
      meta_def = self.try_fuse("node name", inputs, outputs, [], "device name")
