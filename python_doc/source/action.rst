.. _action-label:

Action
===============
| Action is called after pattern() and where() if it where() is undefined or retured true.
| Usually,  :ref:`graph fusing <fuse-label>` and :ref:`data IO <const-label>` are done at this function.
| It returns a boolean to indicate if the graph transformation is done for the pattern matched.
| For now, anything other than false and None is casted into true.
| If true is returned, the graph would try to call Resolve() to remove unconnected nodes.
