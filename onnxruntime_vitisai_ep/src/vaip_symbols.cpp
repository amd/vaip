/// @brief This file contains the list of reserved symbols for VAIP passes
/**  Why we need this?
 *
 * To prevent linker from doing garbage collection.
 *
 * It is not so good that every new pass or customize op to update this file. It
 * leads too many git conflicts.
 *
 * Instead, every pass/custom_op need to create a text file named
 * `symbols.txt` in its root
 * directory. onnxruntime_vitisai_ep/CMakeLists.txt parses
 * `symbols.txt` and update this file accordingly.
